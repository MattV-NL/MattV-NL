- About me ... I'm currently a full-stack developer working mostly on the backend with OPAS Mobile and a gradute from Get Coding NL where I was learning different languages to get into the very exciting tech industry. I have been working in the oil and gas industry for the past 3 years and have decided that this career isn't the right path for me. Making this change and commitment to another career is both nerve racking and exciting. Breaking into the industry and seeing where this path will take me has been very exiciting and I can't wait to share more with you!
