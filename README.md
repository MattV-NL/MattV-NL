ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Vey, I'm the CEO @ OPAS Mobile 
 
About me ... I'm currently the CEO for OPAS Mobile, where I tackle the challenges that come with running a business as well as coding for our app development. I'm also a gradute from Get Building NL(formerly Get Coding NL) where I was learning different languages to get into the very exciting tech industry. I had been working in the oil and gas industry for 3 years and have decided that this career isn't the right path for me. Making this change and commitment to another career is both nerve racking and exciting. Breaking into the industry and seeing where this path will take me has been very exiciting!
