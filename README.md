ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Vey, I'm the CEO @ OPAS Mobile

About me ... I'm currently the CEO for OPAS Mobile, where I tackle the challenges that come with running a business as well as coding for our app development. I'm a gradute from Get Building NL(formerly Get Coding NL) where I learnt different languages and built a foudation to be able to break into the tech industry. Prior to that, I had been working in the oil and gas industry at an oil refinery for 3 years. Making the career change has come with its hurdles but it has been very exciting!
