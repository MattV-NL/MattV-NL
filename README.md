- I'm currently a student with Get Coding NL where I am learning different languages to get into the very exciting tech industry. I have been working in the oil and gas industry for the past 3 years and have decided that this career isn't the right path for me. Making this change and commitment to another career is both nerve racking and exciting. I look forward to breaking into the industry and seeing where this path will take me!
